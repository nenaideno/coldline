# [ColdLine - Visual novel in your browser](nenaideno.github.io/coldline/)

## About the project:
ColdLine is a visual novel fragment created with RenPy 7.5 that was
merged into a web application by the RenPy SDK

You can play THIS at the following link: [Here](nenaideno.github.io/coldline/)

## Technology stack:
1. Python 2
2. RenPy (7.5.3)
3. Developer's hands (x2)


## PS:
Never try to build RenPy into a web application. It can be dangerous for you or your loved ones (I warned you).
